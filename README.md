## Hi there 👋

Hi, I'm Ashly Varghese — a Master's student in International Software System Science at Otto-Friedrich University of Bamberg, Germany, with a growing passion for Machine Learning and AI.

After gaining over two years of experience as a Software Test Engineer, I decided to follow my deep curiosity in data-driven technologies and made the transition into the field of Machine Learning. My academic journey now centers around Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Data Structures, and Mathematics for ML.

I’ve actively been applying my knowledge by contributing to real-world projects and Kaggle competitions. I’m particularly drawn to building solutions in Predictive Maintenance and Natural Language Processing, and I enjoy the challenge of solving problems at the intersection of software engineering and intelligent systems.

My goal is to bridge the gap between research and practical application—developing models that not only work in theory but deliver value in the real world. I’m also committed to sharing my learnings, and continuously improving through collaboration, experimentation, and feedback.

I believe that strong foundations, continuous learning, and curiosity are key to innovation—and I’m excited to grow in this space while contributing to impactful work.

I'm currently:
👩‍💻 Pursuing my Master's with a focus on Machine Learning & Deep Learning
👩‍💻 Working on an AI-driven Predictive Maintenance project using NASA CMAPSS dataset
📊 Participating in Kaggle competitions to sharpen my applied ML skills
🌱 Continuously learning and experimenting with real-world ML problems
🤝 Open to collaborating on exciting ML and data science projects
