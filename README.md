# 👋 Hi, I'm Ashly Varghese

I'm Ashly Varghese, a Graduate Student in **International Software System Science** at **Otto-Friedrich University of Bamberg, Germany**, with a growing passion for **Machine Learning** and **AI**.

With over two years of experience as a **Software Test Engineer**, my curiosity for intelligent systems and data-driven problem-solving led me to pursue a career transition into Machine Learning. My academic journey is now focused on **Machine Learning**, **Deep Learning**, **Data Structures**, and **Mathematics for AI** — shaping my goal of becoming a skilled **Machine Learning Engineer**.

Having worked on real-world projects and participated in Kaggle competitions, I enjoy solving problems in **Predictive Maintenance**, **Natural Language Processing**, and **Applied ML**. I believe in bridging the gap between business and technology by building robust, impactful ML solutions. I'm also an advocate for **continuous learning**, and I love sharing knowledge with the tech community.
